Here are links to two separate articles I wrote quite early on in my first semester as a grad student: 

1. Initial SQL work - https://peterbarston.blogspot.com/2021/01/pga-tour-practice.html
2. Tableau Deployment - https://peterbarston.blogspot.com/2021/02/pga-tour-max-exit-velocity-and.html

Code can be provided if interested!
